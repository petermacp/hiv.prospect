# hiv.prospect

This is a package to accompany the paper “Provider-initiated HIV testing
and TB screening in the era of universal coverage: are the right people
being reached? A cohort study in Blantyre, Malawi” by Luke Mair *et al*

## Installation

You can install the released version of hiv.prospect from
[GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github(petermacp/hiv.prospect)
```

## Analysis

Within the `data` folder, there are two datasets: - entry.rda, which
contains anonymised individual-records of participants entering the
clinic during the study period, and - exit.rda, which contains
anonymised individual-records of participants interviewed whilst exiting
the clinic during the study period.

With the `r` folder is the main analysis script
`2018-01-08_analysis_hiv.prospect.Rmd`. Running this script will
replicate the analysis in the manuscript.
